# Predictive Model for Binary Classification

**Author**: Dr. Vinod Walwante

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a predictive model using logistic regression to classify instances into one of two categories. The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset with potentially imbalanced classes, aiming to achieve high accuracy while addressing the challenges posed by class imbalance.

### Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, dropping unnecessary columns, and preparing the dataset for model training.
- **Model Development**: Utilizes logistic regression for binary classification.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Model Deployment**: Saves the trained model for future use.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

**Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vinod290890/GST.git
   cd yourrepository

Install the Required Libraries

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, install the libraries individually:

pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install joblib
pip install matplotlib  # Optional, for visual aids
pip install seaborn     # Optional, for additional visual aids
Run the Script


python predictive_model.py

Project Structure
predictive_model.py: The main script that loads, cleans, and preprocesses the data, trains the model, evaluates it, and saves the results.
requirements.txt: A file listing all the Python libraries required to run the project.

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage information.
Results and Evaluation
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 99.88%.

It performed well on the majority class, but the performance on the minority class highlighted the challenges of class imbalance. Detailed metrics are provided in the output of the script, including precision, recall, and F1-score.

PS - Please be informed without source file it will not work due to restrictution i have not uploaded BIG SOURCE Files thanks at the time of review will show it how it works in the mean time please click Result.JPEG and check result
