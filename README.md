# Predictive Model for Binary Classification

**Author**: Dr. Vinod Walwante

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a predictive model using logistic regression to classify instances into one of two categories. The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset with potentially imbalanced classes, aiming to achieve high accuracy while addressing the challenges posed by class imbalance.

### Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, dropping unnecessary columns, and preparing the dataset for model training.
- **Model Development**: Utilizes logistic regression for binary classification.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Model Deployment**: Saves the trained model for future use.
